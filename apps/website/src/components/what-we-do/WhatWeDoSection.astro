              <p>
                Self-advocacy is a vital skill, empowering participants to
                express their needs, make informed choices, and take greater
                control over their lives. When individuals can effectively
                communicate their thoughts, preferences, and concerns, they
                become active participants in their own care, relationships, and
                daily experiences. At ADE, we believe that fostering
                self-advocacy not only builds confidence and independence—it
                also promotes dignity, respect, and inclusion in all areas of
                life. Key areas of focus include choice-making about activities
                and within activities, assertiveness and appropriate ways to
                refuse or state wants and needs, appropriate relationship
                interaction, building and maintaining friendships, opportunities
                for day-to-day planning activities, making informed choices
                through discussion of both positive and negative consequences,
                and personal awareness and safety, along with other assistance
                in increasing control over the individual’s own life and
                environment.

                social interactions, or accessing local resources. At ADE, we
                focus on building these abilities through real-world
                experiences, helping individuals gain confidence, independence,
                and a sense of belonging within their communities. Participants
                are offered and encouraged to make choices of destinations, in
                addition to our team actively seeking and offering unique
                experiences. Skill areas include safety awareness, restaurant
                etiquette, shopping for personal items, money management
                including budgeting and purchasing, and use of community
                resources such as police, fire, and emergency services.

                Developing domestic and self-care skills is essential for
                fostering independence. These skills enable individuals to
                participate more fully in their home and community environments.
                At ADE, we incorporate these life skills into our daily
                programming to promote autonomy, build confidence, and support
                each person in achieving greater self-sufficiency. Focus areas
                include self-care and personal hygiene, nutrition, meal planning
                and preparation using easy and safe methods such as a microwave,
                toaster oven, countertop grill, and crock-pot, money management
                and budgeting, and basic housekeeping.

                At ADE, individuals are encouraged to express their unique
                interests and preferences when it comes to vocational pursuits.
                We offer pre-vocational training and support designed to help
                participants build essential job skills and positive work habits
                that may lead to future paid employment. Our focus areas include
                listening and attention skills, following multi-step directions,
                and workplace readiness and responsibility. These foundational
                skills are key to success in integrated work environments. When
                individuals are ready to take the next step, ADE coordinates
                with Alta California Regional Center (ACRC) to explore
                employment opportunities through their supported work programs.
